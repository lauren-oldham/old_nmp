# Map Critique Exercise

Please take the time to examine your group members' maps and offer some useful map critique and suggestions for improvement. This can take a variety of forms, but consider these guidelines:

1. **Kick the positive:** "Critique" often has a negative connotation, but it doesn't mean we're out to celebrate faults or problems with a map. Begin your feedback by focusing on what you like about the map. Describe what works for you, and *how* it does so. 
    
    For example, the map may be effective at showing me seasonal drought patterns because the sequential color scheme is appropriate and there is a UI slider element allowing me to sequence through data values using a consistent set of class breaks. The map may be enjoyable for me to view because there is overall good visual balance, a clean modern typeface, and effective use of complimentary colors.
    
2. **Identify aspects of the design that inhibit the use of the map:** Pretend that you are the intended user of the map (you may very well be). Consider again the work you want this map to do for you, and identify the design elements that are detracting from this goal. For example, the map may take a long time to initially load, making me think there is an error or problem with the map. I may be confused where my "call to action" is on the map, and how I'm am supposed to use it. I may be confused as to the selected state of a filter button and am unsure if the data is currently being filtered or not.

3. **Offer suggestions for improving the map:** Consider possible solutions pointing back toward the challenges you've identified (possibly even a couple different solutions for a single issue). For example, I can suggest that putting a spinning loader on the map until the data is downloaded and ready will tell the user to wait. I may suggest that a button or dropdown menu crucial to the use of the map be made larger and more prominent within a sidebar. I may suggest the "selected" state of a UI element be colored differently when activated.

Keep your critique and feedback brief. And, it never hurts to end with a positive statement as well (e.g., "this map allows me to see XYZ that I could not have otherwise").

Additionally, you may consider some of the following:

* is the purpose and topic of the map clear? do you know what it's trying to tell you or what the story is?
* does the map have a good title that includes what (car sales), where (in the US, by state), and when (2015)?
* does the map need a different or better legend for interpreting the mapped data?
* does the choice of thematic representation appropriately fit the mapped phenomena?
* are the user interactions effective for 1. engaging with the map and 2. giving the user feedback and affordances that they are working?
* are important map elements labeled (perhaps through interactive popups)?
* is there a clear figure-ground hierarchy (i.e., can you distinguish the thematic map elements from the basemap)?
* are the data classified or aggregated appropriately?
* does the page/map feel too cramped needs more whitespace? is there an "economy of design"?
* is the page/map and elements too busy or noisy? are you confused about where your "point of entry" is for the map?
* is the choice of typography appropriate for the map and subject matter?
* are the data sources clear (and even linkable through the map)?
* is it clear who the author of the map is? is there a link back to the author's portfolio or GitHub account?
