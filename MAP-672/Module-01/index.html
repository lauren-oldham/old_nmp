<h1>Reaction to the Floating Sheep Manifesto</h1>
    <p>I could honestly write an entire essay in response to the Floating Sheep Manifesto, but I'll keep it relatively short and sweet for the purpose of this assignment. </p>
    
    <p>As a starting point, I would say that I think that I'm a bit of a cartographer, coder, and critic wrapped in one (although still a beginner in every sense of the word!). I obtained a BA in Geography from UK, studied a bit of GIS, but focused much more on the social science than the <em>hard</em> science of cartography. I feel like I learned a lot more about the how and why of maps rather than how to actually create them. After some soul-searching (and urging from my professors, cough), I knew that GIS was the ticket to a job after college. So I started to take it more seriously … lo' and behold, I ended up with a pretty fantastic job in map-making that has requested that I learn to map through code (thanks NMP team! You had great timing).</p>

    <p>During my undergraduate study, I remember feeling particularly annoyed by the history and theories of GIS (sorry, Ate, still loved your class!). “Why is this even important? Just teach me how to make a damn map!” Now that I’m solely responsible for making maps in the small company that I work for, I can definitely see why theory of GIS is important. I need to be able to create maps that tell the necessary story and the need to look good while doing so. What particularly stood out to me in this manifesto was the fifth point about “map or be mapped.” In my job, I map weather events that affect local populations in certain developing nations. These maps are plotted against local microfinance institutions that give out loans; seeing the connection between weather events, people’s locations, and MFIs is critical. As a cartographer, it’s important that I ask myself about my role in the mapping process. Am I taking advantage of these poor people? Am I helping them? Am I unfairly using my own position of power when mapping? (Hopefully those answers are no, yes, and no, respectively.) </p>

    <p>This has already gotten really long and I could go on and on. So I’ll just say that it was a great read and helps to give great context to why there is so much more to mapping than the STEM side of it.
